      I have decided to pursue a career in software development. I began my study working with HTML, CSS, React, SQL, Wordpress and JavaScript through classes on Udemy and
      I've been meeting weekly with a mentor who is an established Senior Software Engineer in the programming industry. I am looking to secure
      a Junior Developer or QA Tester position within this industry. I'm happy to connect with other developers so please feel free to add me to your professional LinkedIn
